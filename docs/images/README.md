# Screenshots

This directory contains screenshots of the Email Signature Generator application.

## Current Screenshots

- `gui-main-window.png` - Main application window with signature form and live preview
- `signature-example.png` - Example of a generated email signature with transparent background
- `settings-tab.png` - Settings tab for customizing colors, dimensions, and fonts
- `profile-management.png` - Save and load multiple signature profiles for different users

## Note

The current screenshots are placeholder images. To capture actual screenshots:

1. Run the GUI application: `python gui_main.py`
2. Take screenshots of:
   - Main window with the signature tab showing a filled form
   - A generated signature example (open the output PNG file)
   - Settings tab with various configuration options
   - Profile management features (save/load dialogs)
3. Save the screenshots in this directory with the same filenames
4. Ensure screenshots are in PNG format for best quality
5. Recommended resolution: 800x600 or higher for clarity

## Screenshot Guidelines

- Use PNG format for clarity and transparency support
- Capture at reasonable resolution (1920x1080 or similar recommended)
- Show actual application usage, not mockups
- Include realistic data in forms (use placeholder names/emails)
- Ensure screenshots demonstrate key features clearly
- Update this README if adding new screenshots
